# SDL
I went to learn about magic numbers of files (file signatures)
and how does our system identify file type using the signatures other than extensions. We can then potentially use that to fix our corrupted file
I also learnt about how we can use Binwalk to detect any hidden files within the file. At the same time I learnt about how we can corrupt our own files to encrypt it such that only we can access it. I also tried to embedd a bat file into a jpg file such that it will run when the jpg is opened. However i failed to do so. I could only at most hide the file in it.
