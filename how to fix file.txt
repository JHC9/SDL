use hexeditor to open file signature 
e.g. hexeditor corrupted.file
example of output:
     FF D8 00 00

since it was given that the file is an image file, we can compare the signatures of those files and find the one that is identical
e.g. signature of png : 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A
                  jpeg: FF D8 FF DB

we will realise that the file should be a jpeg file with the signature and extension


Hence, use hexeditor to correct the wrong signature.
Then ctrl x to save it.
This will then fix the file

You can try to edit the signature of corruptedfile.jpg using hexeditor and it should output the fixedFile.jpg image
